# Student-Habits
The dataset simulates the academic and lifestyle behaviors of 80,000 students, including diverse features like study habits, mental health, family background, motivation, and environmental factors. The goal is to explore how different variables affect student performance in terms of GPA and exam scores.
I have used regression and classification ML models.

****LINEAR REGRESSION****
1. Simple and effective for continuous variable prediction.
2. Identifies patterns in study habits affecting grades.
3. Helps make recommendations (e.g., optimizing study hours for better performance).

Steps involved in Regression-
1. Preprocess the data.
2. Split into train/test sets.
3. Train a Linear Regression model.
4. Evaluate model performance (RÂ², MAE, RMSE).

****CLASSIFICATION MODELLING****
1. It is used to categorize students into different performance levels based on their habits.
2. I have used Random Forest Classifier, a powerful and accurate model for classification tasks.

Steps involved in Classification-
1. Preprocess the data.
2. Split into train/test sets.
3. Train a  Random Forest Classification model.
4. Evaluate model performance (Accuracy Score, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix).
